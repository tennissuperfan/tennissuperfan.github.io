<h1>Top 17 best tennis players of 2019</h1>
<p>Its 2020! Let's rewind back to last year, 2019. I am going to be talking about the top 17 best tennis players of 2019.</p>
<p>17. NICK KYRGIOS

<p><i> Nick Kyrgios is one of the most talented and skilfull tennis players in the world. He might have meltdowns quite a few times, but that does not stop him from being who he is now! Sure, his performances in 2019 in Grandslams were not great, hardly winning any matches, but in the other atp tournaments he is rocking it! He hit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGVqJWro-4Y" target="_blank">2nd best shot of 2019</a> in Miami hitting a mind-blowing tweener against Borna Coric! his performance in Washington open was just magnificent winning the title. In Acapulco, he beat Nadal, Wawrinka, Isner, and Alexander Zverev to win the title! It was probably one of his biggest titles of his tennis career so far! I think we are seeing a future Grandslam winner.<p/><i/>

<br />

<p>16. ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT

<p><i> My number 16 pick is Roberto Bautista Agut. His performance in Qatar open was unbelievable, defeating the world number one at that time, Novak Djokovic in 3 sets. He came back from being a set and a break in the second set down, but he was able to pull it off, and win the match. later on he won the title. You might be thinking that it was just luck, but then he came in Miami. Novak Djokovic is the king of masters 1000's. Indian wells was a disaster for Djokovic, losing in the second round against Kolshrieber in straight sets, but then he was easily beating his opponents in Miami until he faced Roberto Bautista agut. he won the first set 6-1, but Bautista Agut won the match, winning the next two sets. He also made it to the semifinals of Wimbledon, losing to the defending champion in 4 sets, winning the second set 6-4. I think that he is a really great tennis player and that we will see more of him later on.<p/><i/>

<br />
<p>15. FABIO FOGNINI<p>


<p><i>Fabio Fognini was an extremely great tennis player this year. Clay season was his best performance yet. his brilliance in Monte Carlo paid off, to have won the title. he beat Zverev, Coric, Nadal, and Lajovic. The king of clay, Nadal, lost in the semifinals to Fabio Fognini. he was the favorite to win in straight sets, but Fognini showed Nadal who would win the title, and Fognini beat Nadal in straight sets. He came to the fourth round of Madrid open, losing to Dominic Thiem in straight sets. in french open, he came to the quarterfinals losing to alexander zverev in four sets, getting the first set 6-3. there is definetly going to be a bright future for this guy later on. who knows? he might win a Grandslam one day!<p/><i/>

<p>14. FELIX AUGER ALIASSIME

<p><I> Felix Auger Aliassime is a very young talent and a definite future star. He had an amazing time in stuttgart making it to the final losing to Matteo Berettini. He beat a very good grass court player, dustin brown, in the semifinals. Dustin brown has a 2-0
 Head to head record against Rafael Nadal, beating him on the grass both times, one of them being at Wimbledon, in four sets. Felix auger Aliassime was able to beat dustin brown in 3 sets. Dustin brown was serving for the match in the third set 5-4, but Felix hit an incredible shot to get the break back. Dustin brown also beat Alexander Zverev, the number 1 seed in three sets in the previous round. In the same year, Felix beat Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets 2 times. One was in Indian Wells, and the other was in queens open. He got his first grand slam win in Wimbledon and made it to the third round. In Washington open, He pulled off an incredible backhand passing shot against Marin cilic that was unforgettable. This guy is a great player and will get his first atp title very soon.<p/><I/>

Another accomplishment was coming to the quarterfinals of the us open, losing to Nadal in straight sets, making a comeback in two of the sets. The first set, Nadal was serving 5-1, best Diego made him push harder for him to win it 7-5. He did the same thing in the second set, but with different scores. In Argentina open, he beat the prince of clay on the dirt in three sets, Dominic Thiem to make it into the final. He won los Cabos open and beat Taylor fritz to win the title.
